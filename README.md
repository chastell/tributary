tributary
=========

A tiny, heavily [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto)-inspired and (no less heavily) [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)-powered blogging engine.

Overview
--------

tributary aggregates a set of `Item`s, representing individual website contents (blog posts, photolog entries, standalone pages, etc.) stored in YAML-enhanced Markdown files, and allows accessing them with a simple 1:1 URL-to-filename mapping.
